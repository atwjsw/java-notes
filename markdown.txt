1) Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
2) Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
3) Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean.

1) HEADERS
This is an H1
=============

This is an H2
-------------

# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6

2) BLOCKQUOTES
Markdown uses email-style > characters for blockquoting.

3) Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of >:

4) LISTS
Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.
*   Red
*   Green
*   Blue

1.  Bird
2.  McHale
3.  Parish

3. Bird
1. McHale
8. Parish

5) To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. 
This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a code block.

6) HORIZONTAL RULES
You can produce a horizontal rule tag (<hr />) by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. 

This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

7) EMPHASIS: Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis. 
*single asterisks*
_single underscores_
**double asterisks**
__double underscores__

8) CODE
To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:
Use the `printf()` function.

9) Inline image syntax looks like this:

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
